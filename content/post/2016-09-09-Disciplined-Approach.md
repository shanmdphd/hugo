# INTRODUCTION


## Decrease in R&D productivity

### R&D costs continue to rise 
- The median cost of developing any NTD from phase 1 clinical trials to approval is \$250 million 
- Only 10% of drugs tested in phase 1 are ultimately approved 
- The total R&D cost to well more than \$2.5 billion for every NTD approved

### Major driver of cost
- **Failure to achieve safety or efficacy** in phase 2 and phase 3 trials
- **key contributor** to the decline in R&D productivity.

## Late phase predictions

### Failure
- Preclinical models 
	- Poor predictive value of preclinical models correlates with lack of efficacy in phases 2 and 3 

### Success 
- Drug targets based on human genetic diseases 
	- More likely to achieve success
- “fail fast” strategy 
	- Small clinical trials that test PoC 
	- Reduce phase 2 and phase 3 attrition rates

## Decline in R&D productivity

- 3-year rolling averages for late-stage pipeline (estimates of peak sales)
	- Decreased by nearly 50% over the past 5 years
	- From \$692 million (during the period from 2010 to 2012) 
	- To \$451 million (2013 to 2015)

# I. CAUSAL HUMAN BIOLOGY

<div align = center><img src=http://i.makeagif.com/media/7-04-2015/PfdTOW.gif height = 300/></div>

## Definition of good drug
- “Good” drug 
    - One that **binds to and modulates a molecular target in such a way that is safe and effective** in the disease context for which it is administered. 
	- Safety-efficacy profiles and dose-response curves

## Physiological outcome

- Target modulation is **causally related** to a physiological outcome
- Naturally occurring biologic perturbations that lead to changes in human physiology
	- Clues into the mechanisms by which new therapies might work
- Goal of drug R&D is to **develop therapies that mimic experiments of nature** 
- **These causal relationships should be established at the time a target is selected**

## Infectious diseases

- Infections of the lungs or skin 
	- Pneumonia
	- Cellulitis
- Other diseases that were not considered initially to result from an infectious agent
	- Helicobacter pylori as a cause of gastric ulcers 
	- Human papillomavirus as a cause of cervical cancer
- Therapeutic interventions against these infectious agents have a documented benefit on human health, which provides a modern-day test of Koch’s postulates.

## Genetics and tissue-specific autoimmunity 

- `Experiments of nature`
- Approved antipsychotic medications block **dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)** and treat the positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.
- GWAS
	- Identified genetic variation in the DRD2 gene locus (increased risk)

## Ongoing large-scale sequencing efforts 

- **genomes are linked to detailed clinical data**
- Genotype-phenotype dose-response curves can be estimated **at the start of a drug discovery program**
- Gain of function (GoF) and loss of function (LoF), including “human knockouts”
	- Linked to clinical data that can be mined to estimate the **effect of lifelong genetic perturbation on human physiology**

## Single-cell technologies

- Possible to identify antigens that drive the human immune response to infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders

### Examples 

- Neutralizing antibodies that recognize the **hemagglutinin glycoprotein antigen from influenza A virus** have been identified 
- Antibodies against DRD2 in patients with schizophrenia

## Animal models - Limitations

### Valuable
- Understanding of complex physiology, testing pharmacology, and assessing safety

### Lesson
- **animal models should not be used to pick targets at the beginning of a drug discovery program**
- Targets should be selected on the basis of a **deep understanding of causal human biology**, not on the basis of imperfect and notoriously inaccurate animal model data, whether causal or correlative.

# II. THERAPEUTIC MODULATION

<div align = center><img src=http://i.makeagif.com/media/7-04-2015/PfdTOW.gif height = 300/></div>


## Therapeutic modulation - Two major challenges.

### 1. therapeutic molecule must gain access to the protein target 

- Only ~20% of human proteins are accessible by either small molecules (which target hydrophobic pockets) or biological therapeutics (which bind to extracellular targets), which leaves most protein targets “undruggable” . 

### 2. it must exert an effect consistent with the underlying therapeutic hypothesis. 

- As a consequence, only a small portion of potential drug targets is considered therapeutically tractable for a new drug discovery program.

## Therapeutic modulation - causal human biology

### Directionality of the desired therapeutic modulation 
- Therapeutically desirable to increase or decrease activity of protein target
- Altering enzymatic activity, ligand-induced receptor signaling, or transcriptional regulation).

### Examples
- Narcolepsy
	- Autoimmune destruction of a specific cell type that secretes a specific protein ligand
	- Obliteration of neurons that secrete wakefulness-inducing orexin in patients with narcolepsy

## Limitation of druggability so far

- Selected on the basis of **tractability (or druggability) rather than causal human biology**
- Many targets identified by human genetics or other experiments of nature **might not be considered druggable** by either conventional small molecules or biologics

### Example - GBA

- Glucocerebrosidase (GBA), a lysosomal enzyme–encoding gene 
	- Gaucher disease, Parkinson’s disease
- GBA breaks down glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide, a fat molecule
- As an intracellular protein
	- Not accessible via conventional antibody-based biologics
	- Also challenging to achieve with a small molecule, indicating that a new approach to GBA targeting is needed

## overcoming "undruggable genome"

### beyond small molecules and monoclonal antibodies
- Positive allosteric modulators
- Conjugated nanobodies that bind different epitopes of a single target
- Phenotypic screens 
- MRNA delivery
- Small interfering RNA 
- Antisense oligonucleotides
- Gene editing with CRISPR 
- Peptides

# III. BIOMARKERS OF TARGET MODULATION

## What is biomarker?

- One of the most difficult aspects of drug discovery 
    - Making robust predictions about how drug concentration in the blood relates to the final clinical outcome  
- The term “biomarker”
    - Biological readouts along the chain of events from the time a drug is exposed to the target (target exposure), 
    - Engages with the target (target engagement), 
    - **modulates the target to exert a physiological effect in a human system (target modulation)**.

## PD marker

- Most valuable pharmacodynamic biomarkers 
	- Integrate blood and tissue **pharmacokinetics**
	- Target engagement into a biological readout that is **feasible to measure** in a clinical trial
- Conventional PD marker
	- Pharmacological perturbation on a biological system, but these measurements have **no connection to disease-specific causal human biology**
- In the translational medicine model proposed herein, a key step is to **identify biomarkers that robustly measure the same physiological outcomes induced by experiments of nature** in humans

## LDL

- Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
- **example of a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker** linked to **causal human biology** through **genetic association** at the PCSK9 gene
- Human PCSK9 genetic variants that give rise to lower LDL cholesterol protect from risk of cardiovascular disease 
- One important reason that the FDA approved two PCSK9 inhibitors
    - Alirocumab and evolocumab
	- LDL reduction is an accurate efficacy biomarker for protection against cardiovascular events

## pharmacodynamic biomarkers linked with causal human biology

- Population-based resources
- **link genetic data to deep, longitudinal molecular profiling and clinical data** are being established
- United States–led Precision Medicine Initiative)

# IV. NEXT-GENERATION POC TRIALS

## Traditional clinical trials
- Clinical trials represent the **ultimate** test of a therapeutic hypothesis
- **safety and tolerability** in a phase 1 clinical study 
- **relationship between dose of a drug and biological activity (dose-response curves)** in a phase 2 trial
- This stage is followed by a larger phase 3 trial to assess the **safety-efficacy profile** 
- Traditionally each phase is conducted in series

## Traditional vs Translational 

### Traditional clinical trial framework

- Infectious diseases
	- PoC can be achieved by observing viral-load reduction in very small cohorts of patients in phase 2
- Neurodegenerative diseases
	- PoC can be achieved only by observing changes in clinical outcome in phase 3 trials that involve thousands of patients

### New clinical trial design - Linking these two

- Therapeutic modulation of targets anchored in causal human biology 
- Pharmacodynamic biomarkers of target modulation

## Next-gen POC trials

### 1 Identification of populations

- Selected patient populations can be identified for the clinical PoC study
- Ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patients who carry specific genetic mutations 

### 2 Selection of PD biomarker

- Pharmacodynamic biomarkers that are **linked with causal human biology**

#### Examples

- In developing an influenza vaccine, an **immune response to hemagglutinin glycoprotein antigens** is a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker
- As described above, **LDL lowering**, linked with human carriers of different PCSK9 mutations, is a powerful pharmacodynamic biomarker for PCSK9 inhibitors

## Next-gen POC trials

### 3 Digital health technologies 

- Patients can be followed outside of traditional clinical units using digital health technologies

#### Examples

- “digital pills” 
	- Metal-coated tablets that dissolve in the stomach and communicate wirelessly with a mobile device), 
- Continuous monitoring devices
	- Glucose-sensing contact lenses
- Consumer-based laboratory testing (such as smartphone kits) 

## Next-gen POC trials

### 4 Adaptive Trial Design 
- Biomarker or clinical outcomes can be used to **modify** the design during the trial
- Powerful approach to connect causal human biology, biomarkers, and clinical PoC

#### Examples
- The breast cancer study I-SPY 2 

# V. LIMITATIONS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL


## First and foremost

- There is an **underlying assumption that we have sufficient data from humans**
	- Validation of this assumption requires an ecosystem 
	- Work systematically toward building such databases 
- **no single resource** that enables systematic identification of human genetic variants linked to clinical outcomes 
- **no large population** with detailed molecular **longitudinal profiling** to identify novel biomarkers

## Second
- Experiments of nature are **rarely perfect** substitutes for pharmacological interventions
- However, a two- to threefold increase in the success rate during phase 2 or phase 3 would have substantial financial implications
- Failing in a large phase 3 study is about 10-fold more expensive than failing in a small clinical PoC study (\$150 million versus \$15 million per NTD) 

## Third
- **Some diseases do not have experiments of nature** to guide target selection
- Every complex disease is influenced by environmental, behavioral, or stochastic factors that might lead to specific therapeutic hypotheses
- Consistent with this observation, there are many examples of approved therapies that do not have obvious evidence of causal human biology

## Fourth
- **Quantitative models are needed** to translate causal human biology into therapeutic hypotheses that can be tested via pharmacodynamic biomarkers or clinical outcomes in small PoC trials
- For example, human genetics might suggest that modulating a target will have a desired effect in humans, but genetic data might not indicate how much to modulate the target for a desired therapeutic window

## Fifth
- **New digital health technologies** must enable clinical trial designs that test previously untestable therapeutic hypotheses

## Summary and Conclusions
- Decreased productivity in therapeutics research and development (R&D) 
    - Drug costs up while delivering insufficient value to patients 
- Model of translational medicine that connects four components of the early R&D pipeline
    1. causal human biology
    2. therapeutic modality
    3. biomarkers of target modulation
	4. proof-of-concept clinical trials
- Technological advances and a disciplined approach
- This translational medicine approach will not eliminate all late-stage R&D failures—
- Drug discovery is an inherently risky business, after all—but it should help
